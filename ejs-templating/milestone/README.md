For this milestone target, you must update your To-do Manager **Node.js** repository to render content using `ejs` view templates on Heroku.

## Requirements

1. Introduce `ejs` in the existing application and render an Index page.
2. Render **Header** content using view templates on the Index page.
3. Deploy your application to Heroku.

All of the above has already been done in the tutorials, so you'll be able to implement them by simply following them.

## New requirements

There are two additional requirements that are not covered in the tutorials:

1. Display the already created **Todos** in the index page using a view template with JavaScript.
2. Add a **Footer** section as a view template and include it on the Index page.
3. Finally, you should deploy this application to Heroku and submit the application URL along with the GitHub source URL.
