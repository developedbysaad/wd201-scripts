We use database to persist data. While running tests, we might insert or delete rows from the database. So it is a common practise to use a separate database for the purpose of testing. By doing this, we can easily create or destroy tables with peace of mind.

If we check the config.json file generated by sequelize-cli, it already has a configuration assigned to test. We will modify npm scripts to use this configuration for running tests.

First, we add a npm script to create the database for test purposes.
```json
"db:create:test": "NODE_ENV=test npx sequelize-cli db:create",
```

Then we will add a script `pretest` which will run before running `test` script.

```json
"pretest": "NODE_ENV=test npx sequelize-cli db:reset"
```

And finally modify the `test` script to use the `test` database configuration.

Now, we can execute the scripts to create test database.

```sh
npm run db:create:test
```

Next we can run the tests and it would use the credentials for test database.

```sh
npm test
```

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we have learned how to configure and use a separate database for testing purposes.
