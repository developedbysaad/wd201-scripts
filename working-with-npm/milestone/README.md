**Important Notes:**
>
> 1. You must format the code using `prettier` before submitting it.
> 2. You must read the problem description carefully before making your submission. Do not miss the details - the program should perfectly match the specifications.
> 3. Take your time, sweat the details, and make every submission count!

## Problem Description
To complete this milestone, you have to make two updates to the **Node.js** program you have created at this level, as per the details given.

1. Create a new HTML page to showcase your previous project HTML. (You can make use of the `registration.html` you created in WD101 as a part of Capstone and name the file the same.)
2. Add a **Link** to the *Projects list* page to point to the *Survey page*.
3. Create a new route to the *Registration page* and make sure the navigation from the *Projects page* works fine.

## Submission Requirements
1. The Survey page should be imported through CLI commands.
2. The Node program should get a file path as input for the Survey page.
3. The result should be streamed to the browser.

Meet you in the next level!
