In this lesson, we will learn about `npm`, the Node Package Manager and how and why it is used in NodeJS development.

## What is `npm`?

`npm` (Node Package Manager) is a command-line tool for installing, creating and sharing packages of NodeJS JavaScript code. There are many open-source packages available on `npm`, like packages for working with dates or fetching data from a web server.

Many businesses also use `npm` to manage private development within their organizations. `npm` is made up of three distinct elements:

1. [`npm` website](https://www.npmjs.com/) – used for finding packages, creating profiles, and managing other aspects of our `npm` usage
2. CLI or a Command Line Interface (CLI) – used to interact with `npm` and is run from a Terminal/Command Prompt.
3. `npm` registry – used as the public database of JavaScript software/dependencies.

## Why use `npm`?

There are a lot of benefits of using `npm`. Some major ones are as listed below:

1. It is easier to adapt code packages for your applications, or simply use them as-is.
2. Helpful in installing standalone tools that you can use right away.
3. Can be used to distribute code to any `npm` user.
4. Manage multiple code versions and code dependencies.
5. When the underlying code is updated, it is simple to update applications.
6. Discover various approaches to solving the same problem.

## Working with `npm`

`npm` is bundled along with NodeJS while you install it. If you have followed the previous lesson to get NodeJS set up on your system, you will already have `npm` configured for you to work with.

To check if you already have NodeJS and `npm` installed, run the following commands on your Terminal:

```js
node --version

npm --version
```

The above commands will provide you with details about the NodeJS and `npm` versions installed on your system.

In the upcoming lessons, we will learn more about the ways in which we can use `npm` to configure and work with our NodeJS application.
