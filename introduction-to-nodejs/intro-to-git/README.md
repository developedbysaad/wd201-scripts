If you are working on a project over time, you may want to keep track of which changes were made, by whom, and when those changes were made. This becomes increasingly important if you end up having a bug in your code! Git can help you with this.

Git is a version control system and in this lesson we will learn more about that.

### What is Version Control System?
As we all know, any software product is developed by several engineers. A version control system helps these developers to track and manage changes done to the software code. So they can simultaneously work on the same project, without interfering with another person's work.

Normally most people gets confused between Git and GitHub. They think both are same. But that's not true. Git is the Vision Control System which you can install in your computer to manage source code history. Whereas, Github is the hosting service for projects that use git.

### What you can do with git?
With git you can:
- Record changes in your project and its files
- Revert back to previous state of a file, at different points in time
- Collaborate with multiple people on one codebase
- See changes over time
- Develop multiple features at once

So, letâ€™s get started on using Git now. First, follow the link given below to install git in your system. This link will lead you to Git's official website. Check the installation steps based on the operating system you have.

Once the installation is complete, verify it by using the following command in the terminal:

````

````

So, see you in the next lesson.
