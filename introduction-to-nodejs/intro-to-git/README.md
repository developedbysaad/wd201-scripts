If you are working on a project over time, you may want to keep track of which changes were made, by whom, and when those changes were made. This becomes increasingly important if you end up having a bug in your code! Git can help you with this.

Git is a version control system and in this lesson we will learn more about that.

### What is Version Control System?
As we all know, any software product is developed by several engineers. A version control system helps these developers to track and manage changes done to the software code. So they can simultaneously work on the same project, without interfering with another person's work.

And one of the most popular version control system is Git. And in this lesson we will learn more about that.

Normally most people gets confused between Git and GitHub. They think both are same. But that's not true. Git is the Vision Control System which you can install in your computer to manage source code history. Whereas, Github is the hosting service for projects that use git.

### What is Git?
Git is a version control system that you download onto your computer. It is essential that you use Git if you want to collaborate with other developers on a coding project or work on your own project.

In order to check if you already have Git installed on your computer you can type the command git --version in the terminal.

If you already have Git installed then you will see what version you have. If you donâ€™t have Git installed you can visit the Git website and easily follow the download instructions to install the correct version for your operating system.

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a product that allows you to host your Git projects on a remote server somewhere (or in other words, in the cloud).

It's important to remember that GitHub is not Git. GitHub is just a hosting service. There are other companies who offer hosting services that do the same thing as GitHub, such as Bitbucket and GitLab.
