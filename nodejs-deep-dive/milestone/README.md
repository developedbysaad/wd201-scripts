## Problem Description
To complete this milestone, you have to work on top of the To-Do manager application that we've just created using Closure.

Your program must output a to-do list that looks like this:
````
My Todo-list

Overdue
[ ] Submit assignment 2020-01-21


Due Today
[x] Pay rent
[ ] Service vehicle


Due Later
[ ] File taxes 2020-01-23
[ ] Call Acme Corp. 2020-01-23
````
  
####  Please read the following notes:

1. Inside the `todoList` function, define a method `toDisplayableList`.
2. In that function, loop through all To-Dos and create three separate categories, like: Overdue, Due Today, Due Later.
3. For todos that are due today, do not show the date. For all other todos, show the date.
4. Create a new folder project and copy the whole To-Do manager implementation in a single file `index.js`.
5. Initialize a git repository
6. Commit the changes with proper messages.
7. Push the code to a new GitHub repository and share the URL with us.

Have fun!
