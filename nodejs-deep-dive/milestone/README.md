## Problem Description
To complete this milestone, you have to work on top of the To-Do manager application that we've just created using Closure.
  
1. Inside the `todoList` function, define a method called `delete` to delete any To-Do by it's array index. 
2. Create a new folder project and copy the whole To-Do manager implementation in a single file `index.js`.
3. Initialize a git repository
4. Commit the changes with proper messages.
5. Push the code to a new GitHub repository and share the URL with us.

Have fun!
