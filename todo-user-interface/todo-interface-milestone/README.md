## Problem Description
To complete this milestone, you have to make two changes to the To-Do manager HTML page, as per the design given.

1. Show the number of Todo's for every category (Overdue, Due Today, Due Later), just after the heading.
2. Create a EJS partial named `todos.ejs` inside the `views` folder, and move the UI for listing Todos to that file.
3. Render the `todos.ejs` partial after every category heading (Overdue, Due Today, Due Later). The goal is to control UI for listing Todos from a single file.

## Submission Requirements
1. After the implementation, commit your changes and push the code to GitHub.
   
#### Try to make the HTML and CSS look as close to the design as possible.
But don't worry if it is not identical. Don't spend more than 3 hours on this target. Just do your best and submit. It takes a long time to truly master front-end development, so don't fret about this :)

#### Well-formatted code is a must.
Remember to format the code - both the HTML and CSS. This one is non-negotiable as always.

Have fun!
