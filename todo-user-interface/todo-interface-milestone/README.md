## Problem Description
To complete this milestone, you have to make two changes to the To-Do manager HTML page, as per the design given.

1. Show the number of Todo's for every category (Due Today, Due Tomorrow, Remaining), just after the heading.
2. And for remaining To-dos, show the due date just after the To-Do description.
3. Move the custom CSS to a separate file.
   
## Submission Requirements
1. Initialize a git repository in the project folder and push the code to GitHub.
2. Deploy the project on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).
   
#### Try to make the HTML and CSS look as close to the design as possible.
But don't worry if it is not identical. Don't spend more than 3 hours on this target. Just do your best and submit. It takes a long time to truly master front-end development, so don't fret this one :)

#### Well-formatted code is a must.
Remember to format the code - both the HTML and CSS. This one is non-negotiable as always.

Have fun!
