API stands for Application Programming Interface. It acts as an intermediatery between two applications to talk to each other. An example would be login to a website using Google or Facebook account. When a user authenticates with Google account, the data that the user is authenticated is passed on from a service from Google to the website. APIs makes this possible. It make sure different services can communicate and share data based on some pre set conditions.

While programming with Node.js, we are making use of many built in modules or external packages. In fact, we are stitching together the APIs to get our work done. If we look at our `Todo` seqeulize model, we are exposing few methods like `addTask`, `markAsComplete` to make changes to database. The Express.js application in fact uses them to create a new item or mark an existing one as complete. This is another example of API.

In software development, APIs helps in building on top of other services. It can be said to be a contract which each of the building block is guaranteed to deliver. You can learn more abou API by wtaching the following video.
