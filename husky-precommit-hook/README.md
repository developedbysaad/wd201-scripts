## Script

In this lesson, we will add a `pre-commit` hook to run the tests and linting automatically before each commit.

We will do this with the help of a package called `husky`.

> Action: Open https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky in a browser.

Let's first add `husky` to our project. Open the integrated terminal and install the package using the following command.

> Action: Switch over to terminal and execute following command

```sh
npm install husky -D
```

Next, we will add a prepare script, which will configure `git` to use `.husky` folder to use as hooks path.

> Action: Switch over to terminal and execute following command

```sh
npm set-script prepare "husky install"
```

Now, we need to run the `prepare` script to fulfill the prerequisites.

> Action: Switch over to terminal and execute following command

```sh
npm run prepare
```

Next, we can add a `pre-commit` hook using husky to run the tests.

> Action: Switch over to terminal and execute following command

```sh
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm test"
git add .husky/pre-commit
```

Let's try to do a commit now.

> Action: Switch over to terminal and execute following command

```sh
git commit -m "Add pre-commit hook to run tests"
```

We can see that the tests are automatically executed before the changes are committed.

> Action: Highlight the test result showing up in the terminal.

Next, we will add automatic code linting checks. We do that with the help of a package called `lint-staged`.

> Action: Open https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged in browser.

Let's add it to our project.

> Action: Open the terminal and execute the command.

```sh
npm install lint-staged -D
```

Next, we will configure lint-staged to run eslint and prettier. We would do that by editing the package.json file.

> Action: Open `package.json` file and add the following configuration

```json
"lint-staged": {
    "*.js": [
      "eslint",
      "prettier --write"
    ]
  },

```

Next, we will edit the pre-commit hook configuration to run lint-staged as well. Let's switch to the terminal and execute the following command.

> Action: switch to terminal and execute the command

```sh
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx lint-staged"
```

Now let's test the whole set up. Let's edit one of the file and stage it.

> TODO: Update based on Todo example once Avishek completes "Letâ€™s write a to-do application"

Let's switch over to the terminal and stage the file.

```sh
git add --all
```

Now, when we try to commit, husky should run our tests and `lint-staged` automatically. Let's try that.

```sh
git commit -m "Add lint-staged"
```

As you can see, our tests, eslint rules, and prettier were run as intended. This helps us in making sure the code that is being committed adheres to a common standard that we have put across for the project.

## Text

We use `husky` to add a pre-commit hook to our project. To install and configure `husky`:

```sh
npm install husky -D
npm set-script prepare "husky install"
npm run prepare
```

Add a pre-commit hook by executing following commands:

```sh
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm test"
git add .husky/pre-commit
```

To see pre-commit hook in action:

```sh
git commit -m "Add pre-commit hook to run tests"
```

We can enforce consistent code formatting, styling in our codebase by making use of `lint-staged`. To add it to our project, install it first.

```sh
npm install lint-staged -D
```

Edit `package.json` to add configuration for `lint-staged`.

```json
"lint-staged": {
    "*.js": [
      "eslint",
      "prettier --write"
    ]
  },

```

Update pre-commit hook enabled by husky.

```sh
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx lint-staged"
```

That's all there to do automatic linting and formatting using husky in a Node.js project.
